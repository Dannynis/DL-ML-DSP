# Python Solutions to Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course Excercises

## About

This repository is a work in progress.  It contains a set of Jupyter notebooks solving the homework problems for Andrew Ng's Machine Learning Course.  Other Python solutions have been published online previously.  The solutions here were developed independently.  My goals are to 1) polish these notebooks to establish a clear correspondence between function signatures in the Python notebooks and original Octave implementations, and 2) implement the scikit-learn one-liners at the bottom of each notebook that provide an alternative set of solutions.  So far, I have polished the Jupyter notebook solutions for Exercises 1-4.  Solutions to exercises 5-8 will be polished soon.
